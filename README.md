## What is RFM?
RFM is a method used to analyze customer value. RFM stands for RECENCY, Frequency, and Monetary.

RECENCY: How recently did the customer visit our website or how recently did a customer purchase?

## Recommendations:
Based on the above R-F-M score, we can give some Recommendations.

**Best Customers**: We can Reward them for their multiples purchases. They can be early adopters to very new products. Suggest them “Refer a friend”. Also, they can be the most loyal customers that have the habit to order.

**Lost Cheap Customers**: Send them personalized emails/messages/notifications to encourage them to order.


**Big Spenders**: Notify them about the discounts to keep them spending more and more money on your products

**Loyal Customers**: Create loyalty cards in which they can gain points each time of purchasing and these points could transfer into a discount

This is how we can target a customer based on the customer segmentation which will help in marketing campaigns. Thus saving marketing costs, grab the customer, make customers spend more thereby increasing the revenue.
